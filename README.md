Version 2 of my Football Draw Simulator, this time using React, MongoDB and Node.js/Express.js.

A cron job will be set up on an EC2 instance that will scrape the `uefa.com` website to regularly fetch top 128 European football clubs. 

32 of them will be randomly selected on the backend, based on Champions League country regulations.

The main purpose is to practice Node and MongoDB, as well as manipulate arrays in an efficient way.

I would like to try Ramda for this project, too.
